QFPROTO1.SCR is an Eagle script file which demonstrates an example of
creating a library package for 100-pin QFP test and burn-in socket.

Through-hole pads are named 1..100. and SMD pad names are prefixed 'S'.

Package can be used as-is, or connected to a 100-pin symbol, such as an
SMC FDC37C665 Super-I/O chip, and used for evaluation / prototyping.

All traces created by the autorouter will connect to the pads.  Notice
also a small rectangle directly over the SMD footprint, in layer tRESTRICT.
