Repository for Cadsoft Eagle library files.

Only a fool trusts a package she hasn't made or at least carefully verified herself.  This collection is provided with absolutely no guarantees of correctness.

Clone the library for the first time:
Install git, get a github account, set up your SSH keys and configuration then fork the library. 

This will create a fork of the Eagle Libraries under you list of Repositories.  Next:

$ git clone git@github.com:yourGitHubUsername/Eagle-Libraries.git

Then, because this repository contains a submodule (The Adafruit library) you need to:

$ cd Eagle-Libraries
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Once you've got a local copy of the libraries, you can make changes.

If you add a new library file, you'll need to tell git to add it to the repo with:

$ git add Category/manufacturer.lbr

After you've made your changes, you can commit them to the local repp with:

$ git commit -am "Message describing what you've changed."

Then, you can upload those changes to the GitHub version of the repo with:

$ git push origin master
