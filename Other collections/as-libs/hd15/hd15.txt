High-density 3-row D-SUB connectors / 15 pin
HD* devices are neutral, VGA* devices have added VGA graphics
connector signal labels.
*_NP devices are symbols without PCB elements (for free-hand wiring),
non-*_NP devices are fro PCB mounting.
*F are female (sockets), *M are male (plugs) connectors (though I have
not seen any male HD15 PCB connector yet, so keep in mind that the 
HD15M/VGAM PCB layouts are just clever guessing !)

Disclaimer:
Any usage of these devices is at your own risk. They have been
carefully designed, but may still contain errors, especially
since they have not been used yet in a real PCB layout.
This library may be used and copied free of charge. In case
any error is detected, please contact the author:
