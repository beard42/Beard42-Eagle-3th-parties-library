TOSHIBA single-gate CMOS devices (SMD packages).
Devices are produced in large and small packages, with the large
packages defined as default for this library. Functions are
equivalent to the corresponding 40xx/45xx standard CMOS gates
as shown in the symbols.

Disclaimer:
Any usage of these devices is at your own risk. They have been
carefully designed, but may still contain errors, especially
since they have not been used yet in a real PCB layout.
This library may be used and copied free of charge. In case
any error is detected, please contact the author:
